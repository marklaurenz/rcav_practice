<h1>Our Little Calculator</h1>

<p>Our little calculator has an infinite number of resources available for you. The resources all live at URLs according to the following scheme:</p>

<form>
  <div>
    <label for="number" >Your Number:</label>
    <input name="number" type="integer" id="first">
  </div>
  <div>
    <input type="submit" value="Submit">
  </div>
</form>

<ul>
  <li>The square of a particular NUMBER lives at the URL <a href="/square/NUMBER"> /square/NUMBER </a></li>
  <li>The square root of a particular NUMBER lives at the URL <a href="/square_root/NUMBER"> /square_root/NUMBER </a></li>
  <li>
    The size of a monthly loan payment, given an annual interest rate (as a percentage), a total number of payments, and a principal amount, lives at the URL
    <a href="/payment/INTEREST_RATE/NUMBER_OF_PAYMENTS/PRINCIPAL_VALUE"> /payment/INTEREST_RATE/NUMBER_OF_PAYMENTS/PRINCIPAL_VALUE </a>
  </li>
</ul>

Unfortunately, our calculator is not very smart yet and all of these numbers can only be integers. Sorry and thank you!

Your task: Make all of these URLs work.
